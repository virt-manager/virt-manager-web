## OS distribution bug reporting

If you are using virt-manager/virt-install or virt-viewer packages provided by your OS distribution vendor, it is preferable to report bugs in their own bug tracker first. If you are able and willing to try compiling new versions of virt-manager/virt-install or virt-viewer, then by all means, also report the bugs to the upstream bug tracker as described above.
